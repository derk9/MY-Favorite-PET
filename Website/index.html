          Hi guys this is my non-existent Corgi named Wilshire. Wilshire is a cute doggo and he loves to eat a lot of
          different foods. He likes to play in the grass and converse with other doggos as well as munching on Vienna Sausages while
          Star Wars is playing in the background. Wilshire believes in the ideologies of his great ancestors and their Communism Manifesto.
          He wishes to one day instill the power of Communinsm back into the paws of all doggos.
